# Custom Microprocessor

The project is to design and impliment a simple Microprocessor to down smaple a graysclae image of 8 bit depth from 128 * 128 pixels to 64 * 64 pixels. The project is designed specifically for the image down sampling task with the simple designed and minimal use of resources. The project is written in verilog and the Microprocessor support fallowing instructions.
